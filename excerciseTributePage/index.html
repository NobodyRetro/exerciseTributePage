    <h1>Gary Gygax</h1>
    <h3>The Father of Dungeons and Dragons</h3>
    <p class="overview">
      Gary Gygax was an American game designer and author best known for
      co-creating the pioneering tabletop role-playing game Dungeons & Dragons
      (D&D) with Dave Arneson.<span class="notation">*</span>

    <h2 class="sectionHeaders">Early Life</h2>
    <hr />
    <p>
      Gygax was born in Chicago, the son of Almina Emelie "Posey" (Burdick) and
      Swiss immigrant and former Chicago Symphony Orchestra violinist Ernst
      Gygax. He was named Ernest after his father, but was commonly known as
      Gary, the middle name given to him by his mother after the actor Gary
      Cooper. The family lived on Kenmore Avenue, close enough to Wrigley Field
      that he could hear the roar of the crowds watching the Chicago Cubs play.
      At age 7, he became a member of a small group of friends who called
      themselves the "Kenmore Pirates". In 1946, after the Kenmore Pirates were
      involved in a fracas with another gang of boys, his father decided to move
      the family to Posey's family home in Lake Geneva, Wisconsin, where Posey's
      family had settled in the early 19th century, and where Gary's
      grandparents still lived.
    </p>

    <h2 class="sectionHeaders">Wargames</h2>
    <hr />
    <p>
      In 1967, Gygax co-founded the International Federation of Wargamers (IFW)
      with Bill Speer and Scott Duncan. The IFW grew rapidly, particularly by
      assimilating several preexisting wargaming clubs, and aimed to promote
      interest in wargames of all periods. It provided a forum for wargamers via
      its newsletters and societies, which enabled them to form local groups and
      share rules. In 1967, Gygax organized a 20-person gaming meet in the
      basement of his home; this event was later called "Gen Con 0". In 1968, he
      rented Lake Geneva's vine-covered Horticultural Hall for $50 (equivalent
      to $440 in 2023) to hold the first Lake Geneva Convention, also known as
      the Gen Con gaming convention. Gen Con is now one of North America's
      largest annual hobby-game gatherings. Gygax met Dave Arneson, the future
      co-creator of D&D, at the second Gen Con in August 1969.

    <h2 class="sectionHeaders">TSR</h2>
    <hr />
    <ul>
      <li>
        Gygax left Guidon Games in 1973 and in October, with Don Kaye as a
        partner, founded Tactical Studies Rules, later known as TSR, Inc.
      </li>

      <li>
        The two men each invested $1,000 in the ventureâ€”Kaye borrowed his share
        on his life insurance policy.
      </li>

      <li>
        They also tried to raise money by immediately publishing a set of
        wargame rules called Cavaliers and Roundheads, but sales were poor; when
        the printing costs for the thousand copies of Dungeons & Dragons rose
        from $2000 to $2500
      </li>

      <li>
        TSR released the first commercial version of D&D in January 1974 as a
        boxed set. Sales of the hand-assembled print run of 1,000 copies, put
        together in Gygax's home, sold out in less than a year.
      </li>

      <li>
        At the end of 1974, with sales of D&D skyrocketing, the future looked
        bright for Gygax and Kaye, who were only 36. But in January 1975, Kaye
        unexpectedly died of a heart attack. He had not made any specific
        provision in his will regarding his share of the company, simply leaving
        his entire estate to his wife Donna.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2 class="sectionHeaders">After TSR</h2>
    <hr />
    <p>
      Immediately after leaving TSR, Gygax was approached by a wargaming
      acquaintance, Forrest Baker, who had done some consulting work for TSR in
      1983 and 1984. Tired of company management, Gygax was simply looking for a
      way to market more of his Gord the Rogue novels, but Baker had a vision
      for a new gaming company. He promised that he would handle the business
      end while Gygax would handle the creative projects. Baker also guaranteed
      that, using Gygax's name, he would be able to bring in one to two million
      dollars of investment. Gygax decided this was a good opportunity, and in
      October 1986, New Infinities Productions, Inc. was announced publicly. To
      help him with the creative work, Gygax poached Frank Mentzer and Dragon
      magazine editor Kim Mohan from TSR. But before a single product was
      released, Forrest Baker left NIPI when the outside investment he promised
      of one to two million dollars failed to materialize.
    </p>

    <h2 class="sectionHeaders">Death</h2>
    <hr />
    <p>
      That same year, Gygax was diagnosed with a potentially deadly abdominal
      aortic aneurysm. Doctors concurred that surgery was needed, but their
      estimates of success varied from 50-percent to 90-percent. Gygax came to
      believe that he would likely die on the operating table, and he refused to
      consider surgery, although he realized that a rupture of the aneurysm
      would be fatal. In one concession to his condition, he switched from
      cigarettes, which he had smoked since high school, to cigars.
